Recognizing the challenges students faced while navigating ACSIS, we empathetically addressed the need for a more modern and student-centered approach to the student support system. This recent project, in collaboration with a dedicated member from the Iconize team, embraced a human-centered design (HCD) methodology to gain a profound understanding of student preferences for support. The insights gleaned from this approach formed the bedrock for comprehensive engagement and communication plans, ensuring a seamless transition to the replacement student portal.",

        content_2: "Considering the popularity of messaging platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams among the interviewees, seamless integration with these platforms would enhance accessibility and convenience for users. Team internal communication emerged as a vital aspect of maintaining personal connections. Offering a space for teams to engage in activities together, such as group meditation followed by brief discussions, could contribute to team bonding and mental well-being. Analytics related to team mental health, such as weekly or monthly reports, would provide valuable insights for both individual team members and team leaders to identify patterns and take proactive measures. Finally, one interviewee expressed the desire for a shared music playlist to foster a cohesive team vibe. Integrating a feature that allows teams to share and enjoy music together could further enhance the sense of unity and promote a positive work environment. By taking these findings into account and incorporating them into the app's development, it will be possible to create a holistic and engaging mindfulness experience that caters to the needs of both onsite and remote teams while promoting mental well-being and team cohesion.",
